# Database Optimizations

## Description

Given an existing application which generates a report from a large data set, improve the efficiency of the report using database optimization methods.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand the downsides of loops within loops in Rails.
* Understand the benefits and appropriate use of indices on database tables.
* Understand the downside of indices.
* Be able to measure the runtime of various webapp functions.
* Be able to query the database more efficiently.
* Be able to implement database indices.

#### Part One - Analysis
Before Indices:
  rake db:seed time: 1,555 seconds for first rake db:seed
    - total time in chrome timeline: 23.1 minutes
    - total idle time: timeline not working
    - rails time given at top: 17 minutes
    - rails time given at bottom: 19 minutes

After Indices:  
    - total time in chrome timeline: 22.4 seconds
    - total idle time: 12.6 seconds
    - rails time given at top: 7.6 seconds
    - rails time given at bottom: 9.09 seconds
What are the 4 numbers and which are subsets of the others?    
Migration time: .5 seconds to run rake db:migrate


#### Part Two - Search Bar

A common feature which you'll be asked to develop is a Google-like search.  You enter information in one field, and results are returned when any one of a number of fields matches what you entered.

Create a new action in your `reports` controller which loads the same data, but with no `:name` parameter.  Call the new action/view/route `search`.  In the view, add a single search field (and search button).  The user should be able to type any part of an assembly's `name`, a hit's `match_gene_name` OR a gene's `gene` field.  When the search button is pressed, the page will reload and the user will be shown all of the hits for which any of those things match.

In other words, if a user types in "special" and one assembly has a `name` "Special Assembly" (and no hits have "special" in their `match_gene_name`), all hits for just that assembly will be shown.  If a user types in "tetanus" and only one hit has a `match_gene_name` which includes "tetanus" (and no assemblies have "tetanus" in their `name`), only that one hit will be shown.  If a user types in "AACCGGTT", only hits for genes with "AACCGGTT" in them should be shown.

The search should also be case insensitive.
